Like most, I was unsure of exactly what I wanted to do so I enrolled into community college and started studying Computer Science as it was a safe bet that I would end up in this field.

I had no idea what was going on in the game but I was intrigued and decided to visit my local MTG shop, Top Deck Hobbies. Suprisingly, I learned that a guy I went to high school with owned the place. After some time frequenting the shop I was asked to help with some work and was eventually offered a job. Soon after it was expressed to me that the owner wanted to move the shop to Corvallis, Oregon right off of Oregon State University campus. I thought this was an excellent opportunity to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Science and move to Corvallis. I managed this store for a couple years while attending OSU but I decided to leave to focus completely on school and finish my degree as the shop took a bit of my time.

Eventually I came across a position as an Assistant to the Industry Liaison for the School of Civil and Construction Engineering. The position required some Salesforce support as well as industry event management and as I enjoyed management with Top Deck Hobbies I decided to apply. I got called for an interview and ended up getting the job. This position required me to work with many industry affiliates, professors, the school head and other various people in positions that required me to be professional in our interactions. I learned much about communication in this role and enjoyed my time here but after I graduated I could no longer hold a student position, so I searched for a job in my field of study.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"Eventually I found work at Ascentec Engineering doing some general IT support, imaging systems, system set up, supporting tickets, etc. Unfortunately this position was cut short due to Covid-19 issues.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"This leads me to my current situation. Looking for work, preferably doing IT support, data analysis or project management. Studying entrepreneurship, self improvement, Tableau, TensorFlow, and React, which prompted the construction of this website as it's useful to have a personal site and is a cool project. And lastly taking time to decompress through reading, meditation, disc golf and weight lifting. I constantly reflect on where I want to go from here and ask myself if what I am doing is conducive to that and it changes constantly.
