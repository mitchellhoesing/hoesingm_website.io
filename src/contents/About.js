                <h3>Hello, I am Mitch Hoesing.</h3>
                <p>
                   As of July 2021, I am an automation developer at Intel, via the contracting company UST.
                   On the side I work on projects which include this website and an artificial intelligent research project
                   that I am unable to write too much on for bias reasons. <br /><br />

                   I have a couple of goals currently. Number one is to get myself into an artificial intelligence role. My plan to achieve this involves going back to graduate
                   school to provide myself with more time to study AI. After graduation, I will apply to positions that allow me to
                   continue learning and develop artificial intelligence that will aid humanity and reduce the suffering of those with basic human needs still unmet.
                   Goal number two is to own real estate and other cash flowing assets. I will finance
                   these investments with my AI background and in time retire with assets to live from. <br /><br />

                   My hobbies include disc golfing, programming, running & weight lifting, reading, video gaming, garage sales, cooking, meditating, photography, art, biking and fishing.
                   I am open to other hobbies as well as I enjoy diving into new subjects and learning.
